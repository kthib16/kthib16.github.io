I picked up a strong passion for telling stories early, but it's how those stories are told that really excites me. I realized I could go beyond the written word and began to think visually about the best ways to present information whether that be as a simple static graph, an interactive chart or as some other form of multimedia. I've worked as a graphic designer at national magazine, ran social media, and helped brainstorm and lead larger design projects all with the goal in mind of finding the best way to get the point across.

### Brookings

[Nonbank Mortgage Lending Map](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/09/10/mapping-the-boom-in-nonbank-mortgage-lending-and-understanding-the-risks/)

As part of a retrospective event on the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, the Economic Studies program at Brookings produced a number of research looking into the causes of the crisis. I created an interactive map using d3 to accompany one such piece. The map shows where the share of nonbank mortgages are greatest in the U.S. On hover over a county, a tool tip displays both the percentage of all mortgages as well as the county name.

[Are states providing adequate financial literacy education?](https://www.brookings.edu/research/are-states-providing-adequate-financial-literacy-education/)

I helped lead the creation of this interactive visualization which allowed users to explore how well their states were providing financial literacy in high school. Part of this involved liasing with Brookings' larger design department, ensuring deliverables met established timelines, and narrowing the focus of this project to always keep the user in mind.

[Four policies to help the middle class, and how to pay for them](https://twitter.com/BrookingsEcon/status/1061984462878228480?s=20)

I came up with this idea for a simple graphic for social media to illustrate the authors main points. I worked with the author to distill the main points to just a few words each and created icons to represent each of the key areas.

[A tax break for ‘Dream Hoarders’: What to do about 529 college savings plans](https://twitter.com/BrookingsEcon/status/902585146695720964?s=20)

I created this gif for social media: 1. as a way to stand out and 2. because I felt it really illustrated the difference in the benefits for middle class and high-income families.
