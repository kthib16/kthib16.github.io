### Explanation

As part of a retrospective event on the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, the Economic Studies program at Brookings produced a number of research looking into the causes of the crisis. I came up with the idea of talking to those affected by the crisis, not just our scholars and those crafting policy at the time, but our research assistants who were in their formative years. Seeing how the crisis affected their families and their communities led many to pursue a career in economics. I felt that by including these voices, we helped put a more human angle to our retrospective.
