### Explanation

Researchers at Brookings [found that how school district boundaries were drawn](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2017/11/20/how-school-district-boundaries-can-create-more-segregated-schools/) could provide an inaccurate picture of how closely those schools resembled the students in the proximity of those schools. These findings were significant because while a school district may appear to be successfully integrated, ignoring school district boundaries and looking at the surrounding areas seemed to suggest otherwise in some places.

### Problem

The finding seemed to speak for itself, but the question was how to visualize this. There was so much talk of boundaries and how school districts were calculated that it all was a little confusing on what this meant.

### Solution

I came up with the idea to have a visual representation of a specific locale and to illustrate which areas would be included in these districts with and without the district boundaries. This seemed like the simplest and easiest way to get this point across. Immediately, readers could see what we meant by areas not being included in these school districts without getting into the dizzying details of how these district lines were drawn.
