### Explanation

In my role as a Senior Web Content and Digital Media Specialist at the Brookings Institution, I'd regularly have to summarize dense research from our fellows and come up with a shareable, web-friendly summary of the material. One of the more involved projects I worked on was Adam Looney's [look at tax return data](https://www.brookings.edu/research/gay-marriage-in-america-after-windsor-and-obergefell/) from the years immediately following the Supreme Court's ruling on same sex marriage. His data set was huge, going as far down as the 5-digit zip codes of same-sex filers.

Not only did we look into the information and pull out some trends (same-sex filers tended to be wealthier, younger, and live in urban areas) but we also found some eye-opening points from the data, including that this data almost perfectly illustrated the wage gap between men and women.

In addition to this summary, we also created as [separate blog post](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2018/02/28/the-top-10-neighborhoods-where-same-sex-couples-live-after-saying-i-do/) about the top areas where these couples lived for people who were even more curious about the data. This involved me digging into the data and pinpointing the the top zip codes where these couples were filing from.
