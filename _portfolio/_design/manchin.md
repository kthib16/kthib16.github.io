### Explanation

The design I chose for The Washington Examiner's cover story on Joe Manchin was simple but dramatic. Because the story was all about the senator, I wanted to let the subject be the focus and not the design. I chose a black background so as not to distract from the photo and every other aspect of the spread was meant as a simple and clean supplement to the writing.
