Whatever my job, writing and editing has always been a big part of what I do. From my early days working for my college newspaper, tracking down leads or writing about the latest campus trends, to my time at the Brookings Institution where I'd take oftentimes dense and complex material and try to distill the key points for a digital audience, my passion for telling stories has always carried through no matter what my position.

###Brookings
[Gay marriage in America after Windsor and Obergefell](https://www.thibodeauxdesign.com/same-sex-marriage/)
The Brookings Institution examines data from jointly-filed tax returns to provide the first analysis of marriage patterns of same-sex couples in the years immediately following the legalization of same-sex marriage.

﻿[Photos: Air And Space Museum's "Milestones of Flight Hall" Has Fully Reopened](http://dcist.com/2016/06/photos_milestones_of_flight.php#photo-1)
The first thing visitors will see when they step foot into the National Air and Space Museum’s newly renovated “Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall” is the Spirit of St. Louis, with original fabric from the plane’s historic 1927 flight across the Atlantic, sitting atop the 1969 Apollo Lunar Module.
It’s all part of the exhibit’s new layout that is meant to inspire awe and serve as a sought-after experience for visitors, according to Bob van der Linden, curator of aeronautics at the Air and Space Museum and one of the museum’s lead curators for the new exhibit.


###THE ADVOCATE:﻿
[Acadiana residents take a step back in history during Le Boucherie Merci, enjoy Cajun delicacies](http://theadvocate.com/news/acadiana/10976610-123/acadiana-residents-take-a-step)
Almost no part of the pig was spared to make boudin, cracklins and other Cajun delicacies Sunday as part of the second annual Le Boucherie Merci.

The event was a throwback to boucheries — the communal butchering of hogs — of the past when people killed what they raised and raised what they ate. Proceeds benefited Vermilionville — a living history museum that celebrates the times and traditions of the Acadians and Native Americans.

[Abbeville chefs whip up Giant Omelette, maintain tradition in 30th festival](http://theadvocate.com/news/acadiana/10711378-123/abbeville-chefs-whip-up-giant)
The old adage goes, “You’ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelette.”

But Sunday, it took exactly 5,030 eggs, 50 pounds of onions, 75 bell peppers, 4 gallons of onion tops, 2 gallons of parsley, 6½ gallons of milk, 52 pounds of butter and 15 pounds of crawfish tails.

[Lafayette ‘steampunk’ fair celebrates community’s creative spirit](http://theadvocate.com/news/neworleans/neworleansnews/10837965-171/lafayette-steampunk-fair-celebrates-communitys)
LAFAYETTE -- The top hat adorning Jezebel Lobelia’s head had a gear-shaped object perched atop it, and she wore a corset with a billowing lace dress. By her side was Christopher Slim, smartly attired in blazer, bow tie and pinstripe pants, with a holster holding a plastic toy gun on his hip.

The two wouldn’t be out of place in Victorian-era London or in the Wild West. But this was Saturday, and they were in downtown Lafayette for a special occasion — that being the second-annual ![Steampunk & Makers Fair](http://steampunkandmakersfair.org/).

###COLD CASE CIVIL RIGHTS MURDER PROJECT:
[Re-opened civil rights cases tough to solve](http://theadvocate.com/home/8340013-125/re-opened-la-civil-rights-cases)
The U.S. Department of Justice quietly closed two Louisiana cases, one of which saw a suspect named that was still living -- a rarity for these decades-old cases. Nearly seven years after Congress authorized the DOJ to again look into these racially motivated crimes from the 1960s and before, only three federal and two state convictions have resulted from the department's efforts.

[5 Louisiana civil rights-era murder cases remain open, Justice Department reports to Congress](http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/11/5_louisiana_civil_rights_era_m.html)
Five civil rights-era murder investigations in Louisiana and 10 in Mississippi are among the more than two dozen cases that will remain open and active, according to a U.S. Department of Justice report to Congress outlining progress of cases the FBI was authorized to investigate under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. Overall, 11 cases were closed in 2012, three from Mississippi and two in Louisiana, according to the annual report.

[Details on the unsolved Civil Rights-era bombing of Wharlest Jackson](http://www.wafb.com/story/20630674/wharlest-jackson-murder)
Newly declassified FBI documents detailing the investigation into the Feb. 18, 1967, race-related murder of Wharlest Jackson in Natchez, Mississippi, reveal that Raleigh J. (Red) Glover, leader of the violent KKK-offshoot Silver Dollar Group, was the FBI's main suspect, although formal charges were never filed against the late Vidalia, La., resident.

###MCCLATCHY, WASHINGTON BUREAU:
[In post-Obama America, small inroads with blacks would be big for GOP](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article24751510.html)
Down in Monroe, La., hard by Black Bayou Lake, U.S. Rep. Rodney Alexander wonders why Republican leaders in Washington haven’t sought his advice on their initiative to improve the party’s anemic standing among African-American voters.

Compared with his Republican peers in the House of Representatives, Alexander is unusually adept at drawing black votes.

“It’s something they should have been doing to begin with,” Alexander said of his party’s new outreach to black voters.

[FBI tells Congress it uses drones](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article24750211.html)
WASHINGTON — FBI Director Robert Mueller acknowledged Wednesday that the bureau has used unmanned aerial drones for surveillance in the United States and suggested that government needs to develop guidelines as their use grows.

Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mueller said the bureau has employed drones in “a very, very minimal way and very seldom.”

[Senate panel OKs Rep. Mel Watt to lead Fannie, Freddie](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article24751240.html)
WASHINGTON — Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., overcame a difficult challenge to becoming the next head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency on Thursday when he was approved by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in a 12-10 vote that was split along party lines.

[Holder on Zimmerman verdict: 'Justice must be done.'](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article24751069.html)
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he shares the concerns of many over the recent acquittal of George Zimmerman, who faced second-degree murder charges for the death of Trayvon Martin.

Holder, who spoke at the Delta Sigma Theta sorority's social action luncheon on Monday, decried the "tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon Martin."

###THE TIMES-PICAYUNE:
[Pearl River's health assessed after massive chemical discharge killed thousands of fish](https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_205a9c14-94ea-5ca0-b8a2-8b911f39491d.html)
For a time last summer, the waters of the West Pearl River turned from chocolate brown to dense black, the river’s surface jammed with hundreds of thousands of dead fish. Six months after an illegal chemical discharge from the Temple-Inland paper mill in Bogalusa, the river looks like the river again. Fish have returned to the West Pearl and adjacent waterways, with an assist from state fisheries experts. And local officials and environmentalists are closely monitoring the river’s condition.

[Lacombe trying to encourage smart growth](https://www.nola.com/news/business/article_01940066-bfa4-580d-868f-a744154c4245.html)
At just under 9,000 residents -- situated between bustling Mandeville to the west and busy Slidell to the east -- Lacombe is easy to overlook. That's a situation Parish Councilman Jacob Groby and Heritage Center coordinator Tom Aicklen are hoping to change. They are initiating a program to promote business in the small unincorporated area and lure some new businesses and tourists as well.

[LSU buildings need $255 million in repairs](http://www.lsureveille.com/news/article_51249cae-65aa-11e2-88ca-001a4bcf6878.html)
*The first in a three-part series*

Faulty pipelines, deteriorating door frames, staircases without railings.

These are a few of the items on the University’s “to-do” list of improvements, a list that has remained stagnant since 2005, slowly festering as the projects’ multi-million dollar price tag — currently $255 million — continues to grow.

[LSU heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in desperate need of repair](http://www.lsureveille.com/news/article_fc47241c-65aa-11e2-aaa3-001a4bcf6878.html)
*The second in a three-part series*

When a piece of deteriorated concrete from Hill Memorial Library’s outer wall fell to the ground in February, it turned students’ attention to the structural integrity of campus buildings.

But aged and damaged siding is just one concern. There are a number of documented, yet untouched, issues lurking in the University’s academic buildings.

[LSU building repairs have been deferred since the '80s](http://www.lsureveille.com/news/article_9126f7f6-65ab-11e2-a7b3-001a4bcf6878.html)
*The third in a three-part series*

As the University continues to be vigilant of its ever-fluctuating budget, financial hardships from 30 years ago are still taking their toll on campus facilities.

In the 1980s, the state saw a comparative budget shortfall, and the University was required to push back funding for several operating systems in academic buildings across campus, like the electrical and mechanical systems that were in need of repair.

 Tony Lombardo, executive director of Facility Services, said many of the systems in today’s buildings are the same ones on which maintenance had to be deferred three decades ago.

[Do you know LSU's "bicycle man?"](http://www.lsureveille.com/legacy/article_9850128a-036b-11e2-8602-001a4bcf6878.html)
Jefferson Orwell Opal and his bicycle aren't a new sight to the campus. He pedals his way through the heart of the ground each week, attracting curious stares and welcoming smiles along the route.

Opal, 1981 alumnus, is no ordinary man, and he rides no ordinary bike — it holds his two dogs, any interesting treasures Opal finds on his routine 25-mile trip around Baton Rouge and a reputation that has made him an icon.

[LSU students embrace comic books, cartooning](http://www.lsureveille.com/legacy/features/article_a0119dc0-26d6-11e2-8154-0019bb30f31a.html)
Taylor Wells isn’t too old for coloring. In fact, she’s made it her career.

Wells is one of many students embracing alternative forms of art not taught at the University including comics, cartoons and illustrations.

Wells, a painting and drawing senior, is part of a team that creates, draws, colors and compiles a 20-page comic book that has become one of the most popular creator-owned series in the industry, garnering critical acclaim in the process. The comic is even in talks of being made into a television series on Showtime.
